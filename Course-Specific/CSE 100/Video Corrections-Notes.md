# Video Corrections/Notes
These are corrections/notes for videos in my [*Advanced Data Structures*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM_KIlU0WoXmkV4QB1Dg8PtJaHTdWHwRS) YouTube playlist.

## [C++ Data Types — 3:55](https://youtu.be/HvMd5G_LAHE?t=235)
I say [`stringstream`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/sstream/stringstream/stringstream/), not "string string".

## [C++ Memory Diagrams — 2:05](https://youtu.be/Mz_BcInAj6E?t=125)
Should be "And this `Student` object is called `s1`", not "And this [`string`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/) object is called `s1`".

## [AVL Rotations — 10:46](https://youtu.be/xzmLuS0ZJmA?t=646)
I accidentally said "right child of 8" and "left child of 5," but I meant to say "left child of 8" and "right child of 5" (which is what I correctly drew in the tree).

## [Proof of AVL Tree Worst-Case Time Complexity — 10:20](https://youtu.be/hUzRX1LzGXI?t=620)
I meant *h*/2 (what I wrote), but I accidentally said "h minus 2" instead of "h over 2".
