# Distributing Instructional Videos
In this tutorial, I will describe how I distribute any instructional videos I record to my students.

## Primary Distribution: YouTube
I distribute all of my instructional videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/). I personally prefer to post them as public playlists (e.g. [Advanced Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM_KIlU0WoXmkV4QB1Dg8PtJaHTdWHwRS)) because I want anybody to be able to access my materials, but you can choose to upload them as unlisted videos if you only want private access. Some nice features:

* I can create a single playlist with all the videos for a given course/topic, and I can rearrange/add/remove videos in this playlist over time (e.g. if I want to add/remove a topic from a course, or if I want to improve a video, or add more helper videos, etc.)
* YouTube automatically uses voice-to-text to generate subtitles, which are useful for students who have hearing impairments or who may not speak English as a first language (or who may be at home and have to watch the video in mute)
    * If I want, I can manually edit the automatic subtitles YouTube generates to make corrections
* YouTube automatically processes the video in different resolutions, which is useful for students who may have limited internet connectivity (e.g. they can stream at 480p/360p/240p if their bandwidth doesn't support smooth 1080p/720p playback)
* Students can download videos from YouTube using tools like [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html), which is useful for students who may have limited internet connectivity (e.g. they can download all videos locally on public WiFi)
* I can embed videos from YouTube in any LMS/environment I wish, which makes it easy to reuse the videos each time I teach a given class

## Restricted Distribution: Baidu Pan
For students who may be following my course in a country that blocks access to YouTube, I also mirror my videos in a shared folder on [Baidu Pan](https://pan.baidu.com/), which is essentially the Chinese equivalent of Google Drive. I think some form of manual reviewal occurs every time you try to share an individual item, so instead of sharing each video one-by-one, I upload all the videos into a single folder (with subdirectories to improve organization), and then I share just that single global folder containing all the videos. See [this folder](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1cOCGLdIiylGvdCW_U5MUug) as an example (the password is ``4p2v``).
